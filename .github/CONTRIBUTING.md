---

Mapbase is a project which many Source modders draw from, so it has its own unique standards
for contributions which differ from other projects, but it is still an open-source repository
that is always open to contributions.

Whenever you contribute to the Mapbase repository, you must keep in mind that any contributions
made could be deployed to all mods utilizing Mapbase, which can include everything from high-profile
Steam mods to amateur HL2 maps. Many contributions can also end up being available in both SP and MP
if the contributions are not obviously exclusive to one of the two.

All contributions must follow the following rules:

 * A contribution must be aligned with Mapbase's goals and priorities and should not be "subjective"
   or related to a specific mod or type of mod. For example, fixing an existing issue or adding a
   new tool for mappers to use is usually fine, but adding a new custom weapon with its own assets
   is usually not fit for Mapbase.
   
 * All content in a contribution must be either already legally open-source or done with the
   full permission of the content's original creator(s).
   
 * Contributions must not break existing maps/content or interfere with them in a negative or non-objective way.
   
 * Code contributions are not obliged to follow Mapbase's preprocessor conventions (e.g. #ifdef MAPBASE),
   although following them is usually acceptable.
   
 * If you are contributing a file you created yourself specifically for Mapbase, you are required to
   use the custom "Mapbase - Source 2013" header used in other Mapbase files as of Mapbase v5.0.
   You are encouraged to append an "Author(s)" part to that header in your file in order to clarify who wrote it.
   
If your contribution is accepted, you may be listed in Mapbase's credits and the README's external content list:
	https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013/wiki/Mapbase-Credits#Contributors
	https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/README
	
You may also receive the "Contributor" or "Major Contributor" role on Mapbase's Discord server if you are
a member of it.
